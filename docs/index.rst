Welcome to Backslash
====================

Backslash is a test reporting service, intended to help you make sense of automation efforts in your organization. Backslash exposes an API helping you report test runs, results, logs, metadata, failures and more.

Backslash has a nice UI helping you sift through the results and find what you're looking for to grok the big picture of testing your products.
